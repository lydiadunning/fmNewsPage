Building the news homepage project from frontend mentor. https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl

Built in Vanilla JS, using Google's Lit library.

Steps:
1. Set up the project, creating a folder, initializing a git repository, and installing and importing Lit.
2. Identify components in the project's design imagery. Compare the mobile and desktop designs to fine-tune heirarchical relationships between components. Take a top down approach, larger categories first.
  a. header
    - logo
    - menu
  b. article splash
    - image
    - title
    - description
    - read more button
  c. new articles 
    - New label
    - articles
      - title
      - description
  d. top three articles (probably. metric unspecified.)
    - just articles, no label.
